Day 24 of #javascript30 is making a navigation bar that sticks to the top of the window.

This is something I have done more than once before. With some frustration, though. The same effect can be achieved with CSS's [position: fixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Fixed_positioning), but you still need JS to slap on the class or property at the right time. 

## `scrollX` and `scrollY`
Keep in mind that that IE does not supprt these two at all. Edge does, but to be safe, use `pageYOffset` or `pageXOffset` - these are aliases for `scrollX` and `scrollY`. See the docs for [scrollY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollY) for an explanation.
