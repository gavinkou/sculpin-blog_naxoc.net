Day 3 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is using CSS variables and manipulating them with JS.  I got my mind blown and I learned about the :root pseudo-element.

## CSS variables
The browser support for [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) is [not great yet](http://caniuse.com/css-variables/embed). They also have a little bit of a funky syntax with the `--`:
```css
element {
  --spacing: 10px;
}
```
That said, I got pretty excited about the cool stuff you can do with them together with JavaScript. I can't wait for better adoption for them but there are hopefully also some [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill) for them out there.

Here is what blew my mind. You can manipulate _the variables_ from JavaScript and the browser updates the CSS. Like this for instance:
```js
var spacing = 12;
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--spacing', `${spacing}px`);
```
Boom! I can potentially update hundreds of CSS properties with that line of JavaScript. Nice!

## :root pseudo-element
I also learned about the [`:root` pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root). CSS variables declared there are global but you can override variabels on any element on the page like you are used to. CSS still cascades.
