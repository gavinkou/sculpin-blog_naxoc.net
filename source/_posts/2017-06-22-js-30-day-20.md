Day 20 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is about speech recognition in the browser. It is safe to say I had a ton of fun and that I got completely carried away.

## `SpeechRecognition`
The browser's [interface for speech recognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) is pretty easy to work with. I'm amazed at how good it is at guessing what you say. Granted - it will completely mishear from time to time, but so do I sometimes! 

## Speech recognition language
As always when working with web stuff, my initial reaction to the speech recognition was: _oh, that's cool, I bet it only works in English and in the US just like recipes, address forms and all that._ But more and more - I am proven wrong on the web. It made me happy that I can set the language to Danish even though only about 5 million people speak it. Here is how you set the language:
```js
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
// Set the language.
recognition.lang = 'da-DK ';
```
Simply set the [lang property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/lang) to a new language code. The language code is an ISO language code. A [list of language codes can be found here](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).

## Listening for results
You listen for speech input with the [result](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/result) event. The event variable will have a ton of info, but you can pull the string out like this by making the result an array and running map on it a couple of times:
```js
recognition.addEventListener('result', e => {
    const transcript = Array.from(e.results)
        .map(result => result[0])
        .map(result => result.transcript)
        .join('');
    // Update stuff with the transcript string.
    if (e.results[0].isFinal) {
			// The user paused.
    }
});
```

## Putting it all together.
For now speech recognition only works in Chrome.
I made a [page that can use voice commands to change background color](https://codepen.io/naxoc/pen/yXXYRW). Go check it out! Make sure you use Chrome for this. It doesn't work in Firefox.

It supports Danish, Spanish, and English. It was so much fun to play around with. I really feel like my taking the time to do #javascript30 is starting to come back. I feel so much more confident and I write nicer code much faster now.
