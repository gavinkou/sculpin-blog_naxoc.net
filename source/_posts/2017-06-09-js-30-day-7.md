Day 7 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is another array workout. I learn about `some()` and `every()` and feel good about it.

## Arrays, chapter II
This time we are doing more filtering and searching in arrays. Some of the filtering uses [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) &mdash; an old nemesis of mine. It's actually OK simple to use and I learned that with parentheses you can call functions on an object like this:
```js
const year = ((new Date()).getFullYear();
``` 
rather than:
```js
const date = new Date();
const year = date.getFullYear();
```
## `some()`
[some()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some) will check if any item in the array passes some condition. It returns true if _any_ item passes the condition.

## `every()`
[every()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every) is a lot like `some()`, only this one returns true only id _all_ items pass a condition.

## `splice()`
[splice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) is a little tricky to understand because it can do many different things depending on what arguments you pass it. One thing that is super important to note, is that it _mutates_ the array it is called on. MDN has a [list of array functions that modify the array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype?v=control#Mutator_methods) that is worth reading and understanding.

A couple of examples. Note that the array is modified!
```js
const tapirTypes = ["Baird's", 'Malayan', 'Brazilian', 'Rabbit', 'Mountain'];
// Remove the animal that is not a tapir.
tapirTypes.splice(3, 1);
console.log(tapirTypes);
// [ "Baird's", "Malayan", "Brazilian", "Mountain" ]

// Add the newest discovered tapir to index 1.
tapirTypes.splice(1, 0, 'Kabomani');
console.log(tapirTypes);
// [ "Baird's", "Kabomani", "Malayan", "Brazilian", "Mountain" ]
```

## `find()`
[find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) will search your array with the callback function you give it, and return the _value_ of the first element that meets the callback function's test criteria. If nothing is found that satisfies the criteria, it returns `undefined`.

## `findIndex()`
[findIndex()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex) is just like `find()`, but it returns _the index_ of the item that satisfied the callback function test criteria. If nothing was found it returns `-1`.
