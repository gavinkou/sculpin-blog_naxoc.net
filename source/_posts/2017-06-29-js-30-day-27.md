Day 27 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) makes a neat horizontal scroll click and drag accordion or carousel.

There are a number of event listeners in use to achieve this. `mousedown`, `mouseleave`, `mouseup`, and `mousemove`. They keep a boolean that keeps track of whether the mouse is down or up, and they set the [Element.scrollLeft](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollLeft) property to the number of pixels the user dragged the element. 

## `let` vs `var`
I understand `const` completely now, but I was fuzzy on `let` vs `var`. They are quite similar, but they differ in scope. Once again, [MDN's docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Scoping_rules_2) has a great explanation and example:
```js
function varTest() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2;  // same variable!
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 2
}

function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;  // different variable
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 1
}
```
So `var` has scope in the entire function, while `let` has function in the _block_ it is in (and all sub-blocks in that block).
