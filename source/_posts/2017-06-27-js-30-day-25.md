Day 25 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) explains what happens when (DOM) events are triggered.

I made a pen based on the lesson to try to illustrate and understand better. It's at the bottom of this post.

## Bubbling
Is when an event "bubbles" up the DOM. In the example with 3 nested divs with an event listener on all of them, a click on the inner one will trigger the click listener on all of them. Note that `this` is the _item the listener is on_, but `event.target` is always the item that was clicked.

## Propagation
In JS this means that the event will keep bubbling up (or capturing). If you call [e.stopPropagation()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) the propagation stops.

## Event listener parameters
The [addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Parameters) function takes an optional options object. Of these, `capture` and `once` are interesting.

### `once`
Will allow the event to fire once and then _remove_ the event listener. 

### `capture`
I think the easiest way for me to understand this is that when this is true, the events _bubble backwards_. Try playing around with the pen example to try and make sense of it :)
