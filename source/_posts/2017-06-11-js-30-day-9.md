Day 9 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is about what you can do with the browser's dev tools to help you in your code.

Inside `console.log` you can interpolate strings like in PHP's [sprintf()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php). You can also just use the backticks from ES6. 

There are a number of methods you can call on the [Console object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console) - it's worth checking that list out. One in particular I think is cool: `console.assert()`. It only prints if what is inside the parentheses evaluates to true. While developing it could be a good idea to use that for some assumptions you have. If the console stays quiet, you're assuming right!
```js
const date = new Date();
// Nothing is in the console.
console.assert(date.getFullYear === date.getFullYear, `Dates don't match`);
// See screenshot below.
console.assert(date.getFullYear !== date.getFullYear, `Dates don't match`);
```
