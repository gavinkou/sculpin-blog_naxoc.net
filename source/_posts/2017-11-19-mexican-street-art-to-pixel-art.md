excerpt: "Having fun with ES6 and a rather cumbersome way to make pixel art."
---
I'm slowly working my way through [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/) by [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/). It's been almost 6 months since I did the [#javascript30](http://javascript30.com/) thing and I have been trying to do little projects every now and then to keep what I learned a little current.

The ES6 course has a lot of things that I already know now - and that feels great actually. I understand it much better when I get it explained again and when I get to play with it a little.

Today I had the perfect combination of no plans all day, dreary weather, and acute lazyness, so I stayed on the couch all day playing around with arrays in ES6 and some pixel art. I have loved geometric art since I was a kid, so when I stubmled upon this photo I took of some street art in Oaxaca in the spring, I decided to recreate it for the browser with JavaScript. I am aware that there are libraries out there that lets you do this &mdash; or even editors, but I wanted to make sure I played with some good ole vanilla JS.

So here is a pen with my browser version of the street art frieze from Oaxaca that inspired me. The street artist was likely inspiered by the unique friezes at the [Zapotec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_peoples) archaeological site [Mitla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitla).

It was good fun to write code for the fun of it and doing "art". I might stick with pixel art and friezes from Mitla for a while. This one just begs to be done with box shadows:
