Day 8 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is playing around with canvas and drawing colorful things in the browser.

You don't actually draw on the the `<canvas>` - you draw on the 'context' that you get from the canvas - which can be 2D or 3D. Todays lesson is focusing on 2D and you can do a ton of cool stuff with that, so go check out the list of functions that [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) offers. Lines, shapes, text and so on.

What made todays lesson super cool is the use of a variable that is used to increment the hue on the lines we are drawing by setting its `strokeStyle`. This made it so that I was not just drawing a monochrome line, but a line in all the colors of the rainbow. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:magenta">UNICORN BOWELS!</span>

## Destructuring assignment
In JavaScript the equivalent to PHP's [list()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.list.php) is the [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). So the idea is that you can assign values to variables from an array like so:
```js
var a, b, rest;
[a, b] = [10, 20];
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
```
I'm not a big fan of that syntax. Not in PHP either. I have yet to see a case where it makes a ton of sense.
