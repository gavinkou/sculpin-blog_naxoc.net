I am switching to go work for [Dagbladet Information](http://www.information.dk) (again) from April.

It's been a really hard decision. I had to choose between two different kinds of Drupal awesome. I know&mdash;really a first world problem.

[Reload](http://reload.dk) has amazing people and great clients that are willing to work agile. I have been super happy with the projects I have been working on and I have worked with a lot of the best Drupal developers in Denmark there. Also, if you would like to work with Reload, check out this [job posting](http://reload.dk/job/erfaren-drupal-udvikler)!

At Information I will have freedom to travel with work and in the end the freedom won. I am looking forward to working together with [Morten Wulff](https://twitter.com/nidhug) every day no matter where I am in the world. Luxury!
