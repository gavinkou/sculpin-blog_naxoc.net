excerpt: "I'm changing jobs again."

It seems I'm one to like going back and forth between jobs, so now I'm going back to work for [Reload](https://reload.dk/). I've loved working for [Information](https://www.information.dk/) and I'm going to miss the people there a lot, but I decided it was time to try something new (and old I guess) again. 

Like [last time I changed jobs](/2015/02/24/new-job/) I know some people already where I'm going, but a lot has also happened in the almost 4 years I've been away, so I'm looking forward to getting to know new people, do more drupal, and learn some shiny new technologies too.
