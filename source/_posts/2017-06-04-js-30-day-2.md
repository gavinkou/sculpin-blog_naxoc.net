excerpt: "Day 2 of #javascript30 is using CSS transform to rotate the hands on a clock. I talk about manipulating CSS from JS and about Template Literals"

Day 2 is using [CSS transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform?v=example) to rotate the hands on a clock.

## Manipulating CSS
A [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) has a [style property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) that can be accessed and manipulated like this for instance:

```js
document.querySelector('.second-hand').style.transform = `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg)`;
```
Vanilla JS has a `toggle()` that works just like jQuery's `toggleClass()`. In fact the [classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) has a couple of very handy functions that are a lot like stuff jQuery will give you. 

## Template Literals
The string in back-ticks in the code above is using a [Template Literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and I love them. They make it so much easier to write some HTML in JS and to get variable in strings without concatenating them. To use a variable in the string, use the `${yourVar}` notation. You can even do stuff like this:
```js
var firstVar = 2;
var secondVar = 2;
console.log(`${firstVar} plus ${secondVar} is ${firstVar + secondVar}`);
```
and that will output "2 plus 2 is 4". There is also [Tagged Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals) - that will let you apply a function to the variables you "pass in" to the template literal. Pretty neat.
