Day 29 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) creates a countdown timer in the browser.

## setInterval()
This exercise has some clever use of [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval). Understanding timers is a little more tricky than it seems, so take a good look at the examples in the docs too.

## Select with Element.name
This one is so cool! I did not know you could do that. If you have an element that has a `name` like an input element, a link anchor, or even an image, you can "select" it by it's name. The name is a property on the document and will give you the same as if you used a `querySelector`:
```js
document.myFormElement;
```
Is the same as:
```js
const myForm = document.querySelector('.form-class');
```
Pretty cool!

## string.padStart()
It the exercise, the minutes in the timer are padded with zero using a small ternary if. That might be the tersest way to do it, but I just wanted to mention [string.padStart()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart). It doesn't have great browser support yet, but I like functions like this. Just give it the length you are shooting for and what you want the string padded with. It needs to be called on a string, so I had to "cast" to string first like this:
```js
const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
const remainderSecs = (seconds % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
const display = `${minutes}:${remainderSecs}`;
endTime.textContent = `Be back at ${hour}:${minutes}`;
```

Where Wes' solution is like this:
```js
const end = new Date(timestamp);
const hour = end.getHours();
const adjustedHour = hour > 12 ? hour - 12 : hour;
const minutes = end.getMinutes();
endTime.textContent = `Be Back At ${adjustedHour}:${minutes < 10 ? '0' : ''}${minutes}`;
```

 Both are perfectly readable, but I do like the _pad_ functions. There is a [padEnd()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padEnd) too.
