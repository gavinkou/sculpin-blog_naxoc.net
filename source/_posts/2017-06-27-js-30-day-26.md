Day 26 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is making a dropdown menu that follows you along.

This lesson takes what I learned on [day 22](2017/06/24/js-30-day-22) about [getBoundingClientRect()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) and uses it to move around a box behind the contents in a dropdown menu. We use [mouseenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter) and [mouseleave](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseleave) to react to the items hovered over.

## Using opacity for "animation"
I learned a really cool trick from this lesson. To get a cool "animated" feel, first add a class that displays block on the hovered item, and then a [setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) with about 150 ms delay that adds another class that sets `opacity` to 1. The item should have a `transition` set in CSS too to make it really look good.

A gotcha when using this approach is that on `mouseleave`, when you remove classes that keeps a list item open &mdash; you might get there "early" because of the timeout in the mouseenter function. So in the `mouseenter` function, you can simply check if the other classes that don't use the timeout are present before adding it.
