excerpt: "Day 5 of #javascript30 is transitioning, transforming and using flexbox."

This lesson from [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is showcasing some neat stuff you can do in CSS with [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes). While I have used that a couple of times, I feel a little bit about flexbox as I do about JS. I'm not going to get better at it unless I practice. I noticed that the Wes Bos has a 20 video course called [What The Flexbox?](https://flexbox.io/). I'll definitely check that out. I really like this format.

## Transitions and transforms
I love how I am learning how these two go together to make cool effects. Again we use the event [transitionend](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/transitionend) to animate stuff a little extra. If you console.log the `event.propertyName` it will tell you what is transitioning. Because Safari uses 'flex-grow' instead of 'flex' like all the other browsers we just look for the string 'flex' in the propertyName.
```js
if (e.propertyName.includes('flex')) {
   this.classList.toggle('open-active');
 }
```
The transition uses [cubic-bezier()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/single-transition-timing-function#The_cubic-bezier()_class_of_timing-functions). I am totally fine with not understanding the math of it, and I found [this cool tool](http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) to help visualize what the arguments to it do.

## `include()`
I really like the [includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes) method. It is simpler than for instance PHP's `strpos()`, because all it does is tell you if a substring is in a string and not where. Keep in mind that `include()` is case sensitive.

There is also an `include()` [for arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes?v=example) &mdash; same concept and nice and simple.
