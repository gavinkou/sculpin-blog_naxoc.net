Day 16 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is having fun with a little bit of math and some CSS.

This lesson creates some text and when you hover over it, the text shadow follows the mouse. I learned some good practices when dealing with math for stuff like this. When calculating `x` and `y` position of the mouse on the [mousemove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousemove) event, then use the `event.target.offsetLeft` and `event.target.offsetTop` instead of `event.offsetX` and `event.offsetY` if the item you are listening on (this) is not the same as `event.target`.

## Destructuring assignment
[I already wrote something about the destructuring assignment](http://naxoc.net/2017/06/10/js-30-day-8/) and I said there that I didn't like the syntax and that I had yet to see a place where it would make sense. I think I found a variation that does now.

This is actually quite elegant, I think. The `e` is an event.
```js
let { offsetX: x, offsetY: y} = e;
```
I now have two variables: `x` and `y` with the offset values from the event. Maybe I will have to reconsider my dislike of the [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
