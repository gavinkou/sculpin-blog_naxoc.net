I started using zsh about a year ago after having resisted it with a passion.
My main worry was that I would "forget how to bash" and be lost on various servers I log in to. While there are some nifty things I have gotten a little too used to in zsh, I don't think it has been a big problem.

One thing that visually tells me that I am in zsh and not bash is that my zsh terminal syntax highlights as I type. Yes, you read that correctly. If you are not familiar with the [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) prepare to have your mind blown.

When you are typing a command you get a yellow color:

Then when you have typed something that actually is a command you get green:

When you make a typo you get red:

It also makes correctly quoted strings yellow. I find that a nice help too:

On the [Github project](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) readme there are instructions for installing the plugin.
