Day 19 of [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com) is messing around with the webcam for a photo booth and doing cool effects by manipulating the RGB channels.

## Webcam with JavaScript
Is so easy! You call [getUserMedia()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) on the [mediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mediaDevices) singleton to get a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Like this for instance:
```js
const video = document.querySelector('.player');
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: false })
  .then(localMediaStream => {
    console.log(localMediaStream);
    video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(localMediaStream);
    video.play();
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Ut oh', err);
  });
```

I had no idea that image manipulation was as simple as it is. There are 3 color channels in an [RGB[A] image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)#RGB_Images) plus an alpha channel. I'm probably using the wrong words for these things, because I know very little about it. But go look at [Pixel manipulation with canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Pixel_manipulation_with_canvas) if you want to know more about how to change colors and make cool effects on images with JavaScript.

## toDataURL()
Calling [toDataURL()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL) on a canvas element will give you the canvas content as a data url that you can either display or let the user download (or both!). Use the [download attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) on the `<a>` tag to allow download.
```js
const data = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg');
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = data;
link.setAttribute('download', 'smiling-face');
// Use the data for the image.
link.innerHTML = `<img src="${data}" alt="Smiling face" />`;
```

This was so cool. Interacting with an amazing piece of software like the browser is is so much fun. It's amazing what you can do with so little code!
I really liked the CSS from the assignment that made my little webcam snaps look like polaroids:

<img class="centered-image" src="/img/photo-booth.png" alt="Photo bootd" width="500" height="541">
