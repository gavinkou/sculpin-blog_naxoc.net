excerpt: "Day 4 of #javascript30 is a good array workout. I learned about 'casting' to an array with Array.from() and using the spread operator for the same thing."

## Arrays
Mr. [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com), Wes says that he became a much better programmer when he forced himself to get really good at the array methods. I totally agree that this is central to be good at in most programming languages. Today he talked about these methods in particular:

* [filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter?v=example)
* [map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map?v=example)
* [sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort?v=example)
* [reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?v=example)

These are all methods that exist in PHP too, so not many surprises for me there. Wes called them "a gateway drug for functional programming" and if you have dabbled a little with that it makes sense.

I saw this tweet explaining some of the methods and I couldn't help love it:

I didn't know about [Array.from()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from?v=example) that will make an iterable into an old fashioned array, so you can use that to make for instance a `NodeList` into an array so you can call `map()`, `reduce()`, or whatever array method on it. You can also make something into an array with the [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) like so:
```js
const arr = [...cat.querySelectorAll('a')];
```
## Logging arrays and objects
I had totally forgotten about [console.table()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table) &mdash; I should use that more. It formats like this:
<img class="centered-image" src="/img/console-table.png" alt="console.table()" width="400" height="299">
