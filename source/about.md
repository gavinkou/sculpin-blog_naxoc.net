![Camilla](/img/camilla.jpg)

Hi! Iâ€™m Camilla. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark and enjoy that very much. I am a Drupal developer and I work for [Dagbladet Information](https://www.information.dk/) &mdash; a Danish newspaper for people who are good at reading.

I go by the nickname naxoc on most of the internet, so you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/naxoc), [github](https://github.com/naxoc), [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/naxoc) etc. with that name.

This blog is built with [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) and the repository for the blog lives [on github](https://github.com/naxoc/sculpin-blog)
